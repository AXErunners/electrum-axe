# Masternodes

Axe Electrum supports masternode creation through an interface called the Masternode Manager.

## Masternode Manager

The Masternode Manager can be accessed either by using the menu (`Wallet` > `Masternodes`) or
by pressing `Ctrl+M`.

This manager displays the status of your masternode(s). A wallet with no masternodes will begin
with a default masternode that you can fill in the information for.

The manager displays the following data about each masternode you have set up:

- The alias (name) of the masternode.
- Whether the masternode has been activated.
- The collateral payment of the masternode.
- The AXE address that received the collateral payment.
- The AXE address of the delegate key.
- The IP address and port that your masternode can be reached at.
- The protocol version that your masternode supports.

## Setting Up

### Delegate Key

A masternode requires a "delegate" key, which is known to both Axe Electrum and your masternode.
Your masternode will use this key to sign messages, and the AXE network will know that you authorized
it to.

A delegate key can either be one of your Axe Electrum keys, or an imported key. Either way, your masternode
and Axe Electrum will both need to know the private key. (See *Importing Masternode.conf* below.)

To use one of your Axe Electrum keys as a delegate key, put its address in the `Masternode AXE Address`
field of the `View Masternode` tab.

### IP Address and Protocol Version

Certain information about your masternode is required. The IP address and port that your masternode uses
must be supplied. Also, the protocol version that your masternode supports is required. This information is filled
in automatically if you import a "masternode.conf" file.

### Collateral (1000 AXE Payment)

To start a masternode, you must have a 1000 AXE payment available in your wallet.
You can scan your wallet for 1000 AXE payments in the `Activate Masternode` tab of the Masternode
Manager.

After scanning, a list of available 1000 AXE collateral payments will be displayed. Selecting one
of them will cause the selected masternode's data to be filled in, though these changes won't be saved
unless you activate the masternode.

### Activating Your Masternode

After selecting a collateral payment and specifying a delegate key, you can activate your masternode.
Do this by clicking `Activate Masternode` in the `Activate Masternode` tab of the Masternode Manager.

This will require your password if your wallet is encrypted, because a message must be signed. After
waiting for Axe Electrum to sign and broadcast your masternode announcement, you will be presented with
a message detailing the result.

## Importing Masternode.conf

You can import a "masternode.conf" file using the `Masternode.conf` tab of the Masternode Manager.
The masternode private key (*delegate key*) in your configuration(s) will be encrypted with your
password if your wallet is encrypted.

Importing a "masternode.conf" file will automatically set up one or more masternode configurations in
the Masternode Manager.
